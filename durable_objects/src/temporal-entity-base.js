/**
 * # TemporalEntityBase
 *
 * Instances of TemporalEntityBase retain their history in a timeline of snapshots. Each snapshot has a complete a copy of the entity's
 * value for that moment in time along with meta like validFrom and validTo. validFrom and validTo define the time range for which the
 * snapshot is... well... valid. This approach was invented by Richard Snodgrass and his doctoral student
 * (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valid_time).
 *
 * ## Inheriting from TemporalEntityBase
 *
 * You can play around with TemporalEntityBase as-is with the default type, '*', and version, also '*'
 * (e.g. https://api/temporal-entity/*​/*​/<id>/...). However, you almost certainly want to subclass TemporalEntityBase. Even then,
 * there are two possible approaches:
 *   1. Create a generic subclass (e.g. TemporalEntity) and provide schemas, migrations, and other specifications for each type. These type
 *      specifications are quite flexible and the configurable behavior of the endpoints/methods address all use cases I can think
 *      of, but you never know so...
 *   2. If the unforseen happens and you want a "type" with additional endpoints/methods or different behavior for the existing ones,
 *      you can extend TemporalEntityBase and add or override at will. Remember to specify your subclass as a separate binding in
 *      your wrangler.toml file.
 *
 * ### Q: Why didn't I just use a dependency injection approach rather than this inheritance approach?
 *
 * Several reasons:
 *   1. You need to upload your durable objects to Cloudflare as a JavaScript Class anyway.
 *   2. Mechanisms I thought of to inject types after it's already in Cloudflare as a class all struck me as unecessary complexity
 *      for my current needs. The trickiest aspect is injecting functions that are used for migrations and additionalValidation (see below).
 *      I would have to upload those separately as Cloudflare Workers and make an over-the-wire call to them which would have a performance
 *      penalty. That said, if I ever want to offer this as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS), I'll need to do something like that,
 *      maybe using Cloudflare Workers for Platforms.
 *   3. This inheritence approach allows you to add additional endpoints/methods or override the behavior of the existing ones
 *      (approach #2 above). That said, I'm not sure if anyone ever needs to do that so this might not turn out to be a reason in the end.
 *
 * ## Granularity and debouncing
 *
 * If the same user makes multiple updates to the same entity within the time period specified by the granularity
 * (default: 1 hour), the updates are merged into a single snapshot, aka debounced. This prevents the history from growing too
 * rapidly in the now common pattern of saving changes in the UI as they are made rather than waiting until the user clicks on
 * a save button. The granularity can be specified as a string ('day', 'hour', etc.). The most coarse granularity you'll probably
 * ever want is 'day' so that's the coarsest you can specify with a string but you can specify any number of milliseconds by using
 * as an integer rather than a string.
 *
 * ## Using previousValues and when to supress them
 *
 * The meta.previousValues property is used to find or count particular state transitions by only looking at one snapshot at
 * a time. Let's say, you want to know the throughput of stories "Accepted" by a lean/agile development team for a particular
 * two-week sprint. You could write a query like this:
 *
 *     meta.validFrom >= '2020-01-01' AND
 *     meta.validFrom < '2020-01-15' AND
 *     value.storyState >= 'Accepted" AND
 *     meta.previousValues.storyState < 'Accepted'
 *
 * To accomplish the same thing without previousValues, you would have to use a query with only the first three conditions and then
 * retrieve the snapshot immediately prior to those by 1st doing a lookup in the timeline and then making another round trip to storage
 * for each result of your first query. You'd then have to post-process the results. It's potentially several orders of magnitude more
 * expensive and it's signficantly more complex. PreviousValues is my (Larry Maccherone's) standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants
 * contribution, where the giants are Richard Snodgrass and his doctoral student.
 *
 * The cost of storing previousValues is negligible since it's only storing the diff which means only the fields that have changed.
 * The incremental cost of calculating the diff is zero since we calculate it anyway to determine idempotency. So, you should only
 * use the supressPreviousValues configuration option if you are sure you'll never want to analyze state transitions and you expect
 * them to be more expensive than normal, for instance for large entities that change frequently and where almost the entire value is
 * changing every update.
 *
 * ## CBOR with structured clone extension encoding
 *
 * The entity value is encoded as CBOR with the structured clone extension using the npm package cbor-x. CBOR is the
 * IEC standardized form of MessagePack. Note, the encoding for plain CBOR seems to be incompatible with the encoding when structured
 * clone is enabled, so I considered using my own media type (application/cbor-sc) but RFC 6839 disallows that.
 * So, we'll just have to live with these docs and good error messages unless I can figure out a way to legitimately specify the structured
 * clone extension in the media type.
 *
 * I chose CBOR for the following reasons:
 *   1. With the structured clone extension, it allows you to encode JavaScript objects with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The org tree
 *      for Transformation.dev Blueprint is a DAG and I needed a way to send that over the wire so I had to use something like this for at
 *      least the transmission of the org tree.
 *   2. It supports essentially all JavaScript types including Dates, Maps, Sets, etc.
 *   3. It's an official standard unlike MessagePack, which is merely a defacto standard, although switching to MessagePack
 *      would be trivial since cbor-x package is derived from the msgpackr package by the same author which is likewise
 *      the fastest MessagePack encoder/decoder.
 *   4. It's faster (at least with cbor-x) for encoding and decoding than anything else (avsc, protobuf, etc.) including native JSON
 *   5. Since it's a binary format, it's more compact than JSON which makes transmission faster and cheaper.
 *      Also, if you have a "sequence" (aka Array) with rows in the same object format, it can be an order of magnitude more compact than JSON,
 *      although that does slow down encoding and that is a different media type, application/cbor-seq
 *
 * ## Soft delete and undelete
 *
 * Deletes are always soft meaning that they simply create a new snapshot and set meta.deleted to true. Attempts to GET, PUT,
 * or PATCH against a soft-deleted entity will result in a 404.
 *
 * You can retrieve a soft-deleted entity by POSTing a query with the includeDeleted option set to true.
 *
 * Unfortunately there is no HTTP method UNDELETE. To undelete, you must PATCH with { undelete: true } in the body.
 * Note: a PATCH body can only have one or the other of delta or undelete.
 *
 * ## Optimistic Concurrency
 *
 * TemporalEntity uses optimistic concurrancy using If-Unmodified-Since header. meta.validFrom is sent back for all requests.
 * Use that to populate If-Unmodified-Since on subsequent requests.
 *
 * Similarly, you can save the cost of a GET by using If-Modified-Since when GETing. It will return a 304 if the entity has not changed.
 *
 * ## Deviations from pure REST APIs
 *
 * The REST-like behavior of TemporalEntityBase might deviate from your expectations for a pure REST API in these ways:
 *   1. PATCH is our Jack of all trades method. As expected, when a delta field is provided, it will partially update an entity
 *      but it is also used to undelete as well as manipulate parents and children.
 *   2. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 infrastructure and/or libraries tend to overwrite Status-Text to match the Status code. So,
 *      while we attempt to supply a more useful Status-Text in the header, error responses also include a body with an error
 *      field which in turn has a useful message field. Error bodies are also encoded in CBOR using the structured clone extension.
 *
 * ## Using the @transformation-dev/cloudflare-do-proxy
 *
 * You must specify a type and version in the first two path segments after the base URL
 * (e.g. https://api/temporal-entity/<type>/<version>/<id>/...).
 *
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {DurableObjectState} state
 * @param {DurableObjectEnv} env
